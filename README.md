Coffee Order App
**Built through UDACITY/GOOGLE tutorials**

Basic app that allows the user to:
      - select the quantity of coffee required (in cups)
      - add any extras (e.g. whipped cream, chocolate)
      - submit the order, which sends all information to an automatically populated "new email" in the user's default email app
      
The aim of building this app was to:
      - develop a basic understanding of the Android development methodology 
      - become familiar with the Android Studio IDE
      
(**note:** Tutorials @ developer.android.com/training were used prior to Udacity/Google tutorials, 
 however I found these tutorials fell out of sync with the latest version of Android Studio)
